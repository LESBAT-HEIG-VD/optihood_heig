This folder contains the tests of the OPTIM-EASE project on the FINE platform.

The current file test.py does not have clear costs or emission taken into account yet. Space heat has been imposed to CHP and domestic hot water to heat pump. Clusterization has been forced to no clusterisation, CO2 limit has remained to the value of FINE examples. This code is still being tested.
