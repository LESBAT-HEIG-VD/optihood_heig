This folder contains the tests of the OPTIM-EASE project on the FINE platform.

The current file test.py does not have final costs or CO2 emissions taken into account yet. Clusterization has been forced to no clusters, CO2 limit has remained to the value of FINE examples, models remain simple for now. All storages have the same model, very simple, as well as converters, very simple.

Missing:
- multi-objective optimization
- operation graph for storage and transmission
- clear definition of costs and carbon emissions

## Context
- 2 buildings so far
- Electricity grid and natural gas as inputs
- CHP/cogeneration and heat pump as converters
- Battery and hot water tank as storages
- 3 of the same technology max per building
