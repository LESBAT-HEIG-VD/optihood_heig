# File Description
* **data_6.xlsx** : preliminary data for test <br />
* **Progress_version6.pptx** : description of the code and results <br />
* **data_extraction_6.py** defines a function to create a .dat from .xlsx  <br />
* **new_6.py** (the main file to be run) contains model definition and resolution  <br />
            
In **new.py**, three lines containing the local paths must be changed, line no. **34, 549, 636** (the last one is for writing the results in a .txt file).

This is the last version of the code made from scratch. It is only about individual optimization, CHP model and hot water storage model are missing. Multi-objective optimisation and some plots were made (electricity sold to the grid and inputs consumed).
